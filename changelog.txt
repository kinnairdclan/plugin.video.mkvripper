v0.3.2
Changed ripsize_min setting to explain what it actually does--limit rips by a minimum duration, as opposed to its size in MB as I had previously thought (oops!)
New RPC error-catching implemented--Sometimes, with RPC protections on certain
disc drives, makemkvcon can report on these protections, attempt to rip but fail, then exit successfully. The application now catches these types of problems and reports them post-rip.
