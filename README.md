plugin.video.mkvripper
===========================

Kodi plugin that provides a simple frontend to makemkvcon (installed seperately) to allow easy BD/DVD ripping within the Kodi environment.

Linux-based. Auto disc detection functionality and a lot of guidance taken from Adam Sutton's plugin.video.makemkvbluray.
